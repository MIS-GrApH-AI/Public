    <p>ES version 2021-08-08 /</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Introduction:
        <ul>
          <li>Graph technologies are expected to be useful in the following
            objectives:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Decision support, currently our first priority,</li>
              <li>Research,</li>
              <li>Education.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Therefore a medical knowledge database is necessary:
            <ul>
              <li>Although the requirement for decision support are not yet
                exactly known, but anyhow graph allowing easy access and
                navigation in a large space of standardized medical knowledge.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Current objectives:
            <ul>
              <li>(1) Definition of the models suited for the above objectives.</li>
              <li>(2) Find source of information and procedure to convert
                available information into graphs.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Such a knowledge base include 3 aspects, concepts, relations
            between concepts and "clinical modifiers".</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>( A ) Concepts:
        <ul>
          <li>At first sight it looks that many definitions of concepts are
            already available in diverse classification systems.</li>
          <li>A database of concepts must include at least complaints, symptoms,
            examinations, problems or diagnoses, treatment, etc...</li>
          <li>There is a need for an unified way to identify concepts, as UMLS.</li>
          <li>Historically most existing classification systems have bee created
            for epidemiological purposes, but it is not certain that our
            requirements for decision support will be completely covered. In
            general epidemiological systems work on large populations while the
            information needed for the care of individual patients could be a
            little different. In epidemiology many information are simply seen.
            as true or false without any gradation. The ICD created about 100
            years ago was intended for processing with punch cards.</li>
          <li>Sources of concepts:
            <ul>
              <li>The big classifications from UMLS, LOINC, pharmacology, etc...
                to be converted in graphs.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Remark: relationships are anywhere, at the end definition of
            concepts are explained as links to other concepts. In any popular
            dictionary words are described by means of other words i.e. links to
            other concepts.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>( B ) Relationships between concept:
        <ul>
          <li>Precise information about relationships between&nbsp; concepts
            will be less easy to find.</li>
          <li>Main types of relations in 2 directions:
            <ul>
              <li>From Symptoms to Problems</li>
              <li>From Problems to associated Symptoms</li>
              <li>From Problem to recommendations of further examinations.</li>
              <li>From Problem to recommended treatments.</li>
              <li>From Treatment to Problems, including unwanted side effects.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Sources of relationships:
            <ul>
              <li>Courses intended for medical students.</li>
              <li>Textbooks, for example Harrison.</li>
              <li>Research based on large population of patient like MIMIC could
                help to quantify relationships.</li>
              <li>Expertise from very qualified medical professionals.</li>
              <li>Exercises of graphs on a white board in front of a group of
                students.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Format:
            <ul>
              <li>Conversion of free text. The relations should be quantified,
                many adjectives should be converted into coefficients.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>( C ) "Clinical modifiers":
        <ul>
          <li>Clinical modifiers are essential for both concepts and relations.</li>
          <li>Generic attributes:
            <ul>
              <li>Degree of belief (by the author)</li>
              <li>Intensity, severity,</li>
              <li>Frequency,</li>
              <li>Degree of trust in the source of information.</li>
              <li>Importance, for example if life threatening issue or simple
                disagreement. </li>
              <li>....</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

        <ul>
          <li>Attributes: of concepts
            <ul>
              <li>Main types of concepts:
                <ul>
                  <li>Observation, i.e. the facts.</li>
                  <li>Problems, synthesis of a set of facts, hypothesis,
                    diagnose.</li>

              <li>Relation weight:
                <ul>
                  <li>Relative weights of relations are essential in clinical
                    decisions.</li>
                  <li>This weight could be represented as coefficients from 0.
                    to 1. For example weak relations as 0.5 or fully valid
                    relations as 1.0<br>

                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Exclusion or negative relations:
                <ul>
                  <li>Could be seen a separate type of relation ?</li>
